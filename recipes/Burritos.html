    <h4>Description about Lasaga</h4>
    <p>
      You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in
      the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>12 large eggs</li>
      <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ red onion, diced</li>

      <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

      <li>20 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to make Lasaga</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together eggs, milk, and salt in a large bowl. Heat butter in a
        large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in egg mixture; cook and stir
        until eggs are completely set, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break up cooked eggs into small pieces and place into a large bowl. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the same large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage and
        garlic in the hot skillet for 5 minutes, Add onion; continue to cook and
        stir until sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain
        and discard any excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer sausage to eggs in the bowl. Stir in tomato, cilantro,
        jalapeños, and taco seasoning until well combined. Allow mixture to cool
        to room temperature, then stir in Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon some of the egg
        filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of tortilla.
        Flatten filling into a rectangular shape with the back of a spoon. Fold
        the bottom of tortilla snugly over filling, then fold in the left and
        right edges. Roll burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder.
        Repeat with remaining ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap individual burritos tightly with plastic wrap and store in the
        freezer until ready to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
